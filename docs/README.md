# Docs

This folder holds project documentation and assets.

## Contents

- **`dashboard.png`** — Screenshot of the Streamlit dashboard (leaderboard and comparison views). The main [README.md](../README.md) references this image. Add a capture of the running dashboard here so the repo shows a preview.

Place other docs (architecture notes, runbooks, design decisions) here as needed. Do not ignore PNGs in `.gitignore` so `docs/dashboard.png` is tracked.
